## Using as a boilerplate

1. Update package.json name, description and version

2. Run `yarn setup:example` after any name or version change. This will build and install the node module in the example.

3. Add a new git repo and push

4. Any non development dependencies must be added to the devDependencies and also the peerDependencies. They must also be added to webpack config `externals` so they are not bundled.

5. Tag versions in git so they be selected on installation
